I am currently an Instructor at the University of Massachusetts Chan Medical School in the Department of Genomics and Computational Biology, advised by Dr. Zhiping Weng and Dr. William E. Theurkauf. I earned my Ph.D in Bioinformatics from Tongji University in 2020 and joined University of Massachusetts Chan Medical School as a postdoc at 2021.  
My research has been broadly focuses on using computational methods to study somatic and germline transposon insertions and mutations in human and koala genomes:  
- Polymorphic and somatic transposon insertions in human diseases.
- Software development for detecting transposon insertions using whole genome sequencing data.
- Transposon transcriptional and post-transcriptional silencing via the piRNA pathway.
- Single-cell genomics and transcriptomics in human aging and neurodegenerative diseases.
