I really enjoyed my first time to a somatic mutation meeting with the members of Michael Lodato's lab. So excited that our research presented by Jenn on Parkinson's Disease get the best presentation award, and our research presented by Brad on dog neuron aging get the best poster award. I am grateful for the opportunity to learn from and connect with the leading investigators and trainees.
